# Pymol-Scripts
Compilation of different pymol scripts I wrote for extracting structural properties using pymol:

-  find_residues.py  
   usage: find_residue('selection as string', '1-letter amino acid as string')     
   Prints the prints the number of instances of the amino acid and the position of the instances as a list
